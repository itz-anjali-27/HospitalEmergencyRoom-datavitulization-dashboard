ðŸš‘ Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard â€“ Power BI Project ðŸ“Š

Thrilled to share my latest Power BI project focusing on real-time ER insights!.
This dashboard visualizes:

âœ… Patient inflow by hour/day.
âœ… Admission status & referrals.
âœ… Average wait time & satisfaction score.
âœ… Demographic analysis (gender, race).
âœ… % of patients served within 30 minutes.

With clear visuals like heatmaps, donut charts, and bar graphs, this tool empowers hospital teams to make faster, data-driven decisions and enhance patient care â€” because in the ER, every second matters.
